# README 
Open data for reproduction purposes of the experiments exposed in our master's thesis: "Reducing train delays in a real time context: A Constraint Programming Approach using Conditional-Time Interval variables". 

## Data available 

### Ottignies-Wavre
This folder contains the data related to the traffic rescheduling problem. 
Information presented here are sufficient to build the model explained in the thesis and to replay the experiments.
Files are detailed below:

* **stn**\_layout.txt: representation of the track layout of station **stn** (text).
* **stn**\_layout.pdf: track layout of station **stn** (figure).
* **stn**\_instance_homo\_**x**\_**n**.json: instance n°**n** for an homogeneous traffic of **x** trains based on station **stn**.
* **stn**\_instance_homo\_**x**\_**n**.bmk: benchmark about the related instance obtained with the model of [CAP_RESCH_17].
